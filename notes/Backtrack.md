# Backtrack VS recursion
1. Recursion is a method while backtrack is a algorithm, which is a type of recursion
2. Recursion calls itself until reaches a base case
3. Backtrack tries to find a solution given parameters. It builds candidates for the solution and abandons those which cannot fulfill the conditions
