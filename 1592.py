    def reorderSpaces(self, text: str) -> str:
        pass



# Input: text = "  this   is  a sentence "
# Output: "this   is   a   sentence"
# Explanation: There are a total of 9 spaces and 4 words. We can evenly divide the 9 spaces between the words: 9 / (4-1) = 3 spaces.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: text = " practice   makes   perfect"
# Output: "practice   makes   perfect "
# Explanation: There are a total of 7 spaces and 3 words. 7 / (3-1) = 3 spaces plus 1 extra space. We place this extra space at the end of the string.
# s = "aaabb"
text = "  this   is  a sentence "
